#### Exercise 2.24
The output is: 
```lisp
(mcons 1 (mcons (mcons 2 (mcons (mcons 3 (mcons 4 '())) '())) '()))
```
The interpreter is Racket v8.3

#### Exercise 2.25
```lisp
(car (cdr (car (cdr (cdr items)))))
(car (car items))
(car (car (cdr (car (cdr (car (cdr (car (cdr (car (cdr (car (cdr a)))))))))))))
```

#### Exercise 2.26
```lisp
(append x y) => (1 2 3 4 5 6)
(cons x y) => ((1 2 3) (4 5 6))
(list x y) => ((1 2 3) (4 5 6))
```
Note that the difference between ``(cons x y)`` and ``(list x y)`` is that there is a nil at the end of ``(list x y)``
