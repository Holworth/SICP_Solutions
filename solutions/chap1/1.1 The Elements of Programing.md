#### Exercise1.1

This exercise aims to help understand the basic element of Lisp, such as arithmetic operation, conditional branch and process abstraction etc. 

```lisp
(+ 5 3 4) 
=> 12

(- 9 1)
=> 8

(/ 6 2)
=> 3

(+ (* 2 4) (- 4 6))
=> 6

(define a 3) 
(define b (+ a 1))
(+ a b (* a b))
=> 19	; a = 3, b = 4

(= a b)
=> #f

(if (and (> b a) (< b (* a b)))
		b 
    a)
=> 4 ;The condition is true and it picks b as return value

(cond ((= a 4) 6)
			((= b 4) (+ 6 7 a))
			(else 25))
=> 16	;b=4 and the second branch is picked

(+ 2 (if (> b a) b a))
=> 6 ;equals to (+ 2 4)

(* (cond ((> a b) a)
				 ((< a b) b)
				 (else -1))
	 (+ a 1))
=> 16 ; equals to (* 4 4)
```

#### Exercise1.2

To translate this expression into prefix form, one has to look upon the first symbol that cuts this expression into multiple parts:

```lisp
(/
 	(+ 5
     4
     (- 2
        (- 3
           (+ 6
              (/ 4 5)))))
  (* 3
     (- 6 2)
     (- 2 7))
 )
```

Remember to use indent in order to make this expression easy for understanding.

#### Exercise1.3

One solution is to list all possible orders of these three elements and then use one ``cond`` expression to generate the answer, for example:

```lisp
#lang racket

(define (sq x) (* x x))

(define sum-of-largerTwo
  (lambda (x y z) 
    (cond ((and (< x y) (< y z)) (+ (sq z) (+ sq y)))
    			...
      ))
)
```

However, it is complex to list all possible orders: 6 all togerther. Another possible way is to calculate the square sum of all three elements and then minus the smallest one:

```lisp
#lang racket

(define (sq x) (* x x))

(define (min x y) 
  (if (< x y) x y)
)

(define (min-of-three x y z) 
  (min x (min y z)))


(define sum-of-largerTwo
  (lambda (x y z) 
    (- (+ (sq x) (sq y) (sq z))
       (min-of-three x y z))
  )
)
```

Tips: To exit from racket command line environment, type ``(exit)``.

#### Exercise 1.4

```lisp
(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
	((if (> b 0) + -) a b))
```

According to the evalution model, the compound expression would evaluate the operator and operand and applies operator on its arguments, which are the operands. Thus evaluate the expression  ``(if (> b 0) + -)``, you would get an expression ``+`` or ``-`` and apply this operator to the following operands, namely ``a`` and ``b``. 

It is such an amazing idea that the operators, even the arithmetic operator, which is considered as most fundamental one in other languages, can be treated as data. 

---

#### Exercise 1.5

```lisp
(define (p) (p)) 
(define (test x y)
	(if (= x 0) 0 y))
```

what ``(define (p) (p))`` does is simply name a procedure called ``p``, and when calling this procedure, it would repeatedly call itself. 

Use the following statement to test the evaluation order of lisp:

```lisp
(test 0 (p))
```

* If the evalution order is **Applicative Order**, it would first evaluate operator and operands. However, when evaluate the seond operand, it will cause infinite loop and the program has no response. 
* If the evaluate order is **Normal Order**, it would expand the expression to be:``(if (= 0 0) 0 (p))``, and returns 0 immediately. 

And in Racket V8.3 environement, the program is indeed stucks at the point calling ``(test 0 (p))``, which indicates the evalution order of racket interpreter is applicative order.
